      <center><b>"Butter" is a song recorded by South Korean boy group BTS and released as a digital single on May 21, 2021, through Big Hit Music and Sony Music Entertainment. It is the band's second English-language single. It became their 4th number one single on the Billboard Hot 100. A disco-pop, dance-pop, and EDM track, the song was written by Jenna Andrews, RM, Alex Bilowitz, Sebastian Garcia, Robert Grimaldi, Stephen Kirk, and Ron Perry, with production handled by the latter three.</b><br>

        <br><i><u><b>Composition and lyrics</b><br></u></i><br>
Initial reports about "Butter" said it was "a dance pop track brimming with the smooth yet charismatic charm of BTS". Rolling Stone described it as "a pure, swaggering dance-pop celebration in the retro vein of Bruno Mars, with layers of Jam and Lewis-style synths", with RM telling the outlet that the song "[is] very energetic" and "very summery".Forbes called it an "infectious disco-pop track" similar to "Dynamite", with a "pulsating, bass-heavy beat and delectable chorus".Following its release, "Butter" was categorized as a 1980s and 1990s-influenced dance-pop and EDM song, with elements of pop rap. The song is composed in 4
4 common time in the key of A-flat major with a tempo of 110 beats per minute. BTS' vocal range span from A♭3 to E♭5.

At a press conference held on release day, RM revealed that while the band wanted to participate in the making of their next single, "Butter" was already "pretty good" and "pretty complete" when they received it, so they chose it out of "many, many songs" that had been sent to them for consideration. He further explained that "some of the parts like the rap were not fully compatible with our style" so he "changed or added to about half of the song's original rap sections", stating that "it came together really quickly since there weren't that many rap sections in the song" despite there still being "some gaps" in his fluency when he has to write English material. Suga also tried writing for the song, as he had actively been studying English during the year prior, but the language barrier was still a problem, so his suggestions were "immediately dropped. No questions, no consideration — just immediately binned". Lyrically, like "Dynamite", "Butter" has "no heavy message", with Jimin saying that there was no profound meaning behind the track—the goal was for it to be "easy to listen to".

A video teaser released on May 18, provided the first preview of the song's lyrics—the line "Get it! Let it roll!" was briefly heard at the end of the clip. Korean news media later reported that "Butter"'s lyrics "cutely confess a sweet, romantic love" and has "BTS' smooth-like-butter unrivalled charms melted into the song".
